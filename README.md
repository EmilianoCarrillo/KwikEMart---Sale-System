# KwikEMart

*(WRITTEN IN SPANISH)*

Kwik-E-Mart was an school project I built using C programming language. It is a simple sale-system command line program that uses text files to store and retrieve data. The user is presented with a menu and he can choose between actions like:

### Show Items
When the user tells the program to show the inventary, the program goes to the right file and reads what's inside and writes it on the console in a nice format.

### Buy Items
Here, the user can buy any kind of items that the program displays in the inventary. He can buy many items and the money that the store earns on those sells is stored on a different file.

### Sell Items
The user can sell things to the store but the store has to have enough money on the earning text file to buy what the user is trying to sell. Once the purchase is made, the inventary gets updated.

This is a great program to get a reference on how to handle files in C (read and write), also a great practice for bigger projects.
